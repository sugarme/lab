# OVERVIEW

`lab` is a Go package built on top of [gotch - Pytorch deep learning framework for Go](https://github.com/sugarme/gotch) to facilitate deep learning research.

`lab` provides tool kits for common tasks of deep learning model training such as:
- [x] dataloader
- [x] data augmentation
- [x] optimizer builder
- [x] learning rate scheduler
- [x] model builder
- [x] evaluation metrics
- [x] evaluator
- [x] trainer
- [x] loss tracker
- [x] logger 
- [x] training configuration in yaml file


This package is in progress and obviously there are many changes ahead. Feel free to contribute.
